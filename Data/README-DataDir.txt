The data directory serves has one main purpose:

1. Data in the original format (e.g., Excel spreadsheet given by Professor) should be kept in this folder

As you should never modify MASTER DATA, necessary modifications should be made on a COPY of the original file.
Data that will be modified and/or will be read by R should be stored in working directory.
